The process of determining customer requirements for product development is known as product discovery. It involves identifying worthwhile problems, finding the best solutions, and adapting to meet evolving customer needs. Companies invest in product discovery before building new products or enhancing existing ones. Entrepreneurs and product managers lead this process, working with cross-functional teams to create personas, analyze feedback, and map user stories. The goal is to empathize with customers and determine which features to build next for a more delightful user experience. Product discovery should occur throughout the entire product development cycle as markets and customer needs evolve. By iterating on products over time, organizations can continue delivering value long after launching their initial offerings. Successful product discovery requires empathy for customers, a deep understanding of their problems, and a customer-centric approach to product building. It helps teams prioritize features, innovate, and validate assumptions about customer needs. The process typically involves gaining an understanding of customer requirements, testing ideas, and refining solutions based on feedback. Collaboration between product management, marketing, design, and development is essential for building products that resonate with customers. Customers themselves provide valuable insights through direct engagement and feedback. Different frameworks are used during product discovery to research user needs, validate and refine ideas, and find the best ways to solve customer problems. An opportunity canvas is an example of such a tool.

<summary>Interaction abstract</summary>

The concept of value based product development involves assessing the worth of new ideas and features throughout the entire product development process, from strategy to market launch and ongoing support. This approach enables teams to create the most value for the least effort by evaluating factors such as customer needs, business goals, technology requirements, stakeholder impact, and effort required. By consistently scoring and measuring value at each stage, teams can make more confident decisions, improve accuracy in estimations, and ultimately deliver products that matter to customers and drive business success.

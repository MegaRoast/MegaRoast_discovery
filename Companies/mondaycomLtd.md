Monday.com, a project management software company, has launched two new standalone products - Workforms and Canvas. While they can integrate with Monday's flagship product, the company's co-CEO Eran Zinman says that offering different tools for different jobs will allow each product to be better and attract new audiences who might not have considered Monday's software otherwise. The new apps are simpler than the core service and are aimed at businesses looking for forms and whiteboards. While they are fairly basic now, the company is committed to improving them over time. Both products will still lean on integration with the core Monday.com platform, which Zinman believes users will eventually gravitate towards as they discover more aspects of what the company offers.

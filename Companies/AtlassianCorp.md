In this guide, you're instructed to choose between weighing options by number or rating. After following steps 1 and 2, click 'Add weighting' in the 'Field Options' section. For discovery projects, both built-in and custom fields have field types that determine the format of field options. To create a new field, provide a name and select a type. Editing a field is done by hovering over it and clicking the gear icon on the right-hand panel. Formatting fields with colors and emojis enhances visual appeal and ease of navigation. Emojis can be added next to fields using the emoji icon above the description space. Each field option can have an associated emoji, color, and row highlighting toggle. You can also add weighting to each field option for prioritization. For specific methods like RICE scoring, create a custom formula field. Examples include a 'Triage' checkbox field or an 'Impact vs Effort' formula field to help prioritize ideas based on reach, impact, confidence, and effort. When creating a custom formula field, choose between weighted score (relative value) or roll up (sum of values). To create a custom formula, use the right-hand panel's 'Create a new field' button, type a name, select 'Custom formula' as the type, and choose a custom formula type like purchasing & licensing.

To manage ideas effectively, users can clone ideas within a project, use templates under the idea description, or create new ideas via the blue 'Create' button or '+ Add idea' option depending on the view. Once created, ideas can be refined with detailed descriptions and pinned fields for easy access to important information. When managing numerous ideas, users can merge similar ones, archive unwanted ones, or delete them entirely. To create an idea, one must have Creator permissions or be granted access by a Creator.

Jira Product Discovery serves as a hub for unconfirmed work ideas and insights gathered by product teams. Once prioritized, these ideas become epics or initiatives in Jira, broken down for engineers. A two-way connection between Jira and Jira Product Discovery facilitates collaboration among product, tech, and business teams. Ideas can originate from feedback or requests via Jira Service Management, which are then pulled into Jira Product Discovery as insights. It's recommended to set up a dedicated request type to channel these insights into the discovery project.

The Software Development Lifecycle aims to deliver high-quality software meeting customer expectations within time and budget. Ideas initially considered may not have been researched or prioritized, often suggested by customers or teams. They progress through stages like validation, technical assessment, and prioritization before being committed to delivery. Jira Product Discovery facilitates this process by providing a separate space for prioritization and roadmapping, ensuring tasks are 100% committed before entering the delivery phase in Jira. This unified workflow enhances connectivity between business and tech teams, reducing context switching and improving visibility.

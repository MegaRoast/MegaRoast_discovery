The company is dependent on customer renewals, new customers, increased revenue from existing customers, and market growth for its platform. It also faces significant competition from established and new companies offering similar software applications. HubSpot's quarterly operating results could be affected by changes in spending on marketing software by current or prospective customers, effective pricing of customer platform subscriptions, attracting new customers, and global awareness of HubSpot's thought leadership and brand. The company has a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future. Its cash flow from operations was $127.09 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by net income and adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities. HubSpot's total assets were $3.19 billion as of March 31, 2024, with current assets of $1.98 billion and long-term investments of $311.53 million. Its total liabilities and stockholders' equity were $3.19 billion. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, HubSpot's revenue was $617.41 million, with a gross profit of $522.33 million and a loss from operations of $(23.23) million.

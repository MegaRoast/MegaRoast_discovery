#### Are you Solving Customer Problems or Just Building Features
**Insight:** The engineering team is required to prioritize the development process by focusing on features that directly address real customer problems identified through deep understanding of their jobs-to-be-done, ensuring resources are not expended on feature requests that only partially solve issues or cater narrowly to specific use cases without aligning with the product vision, thus enhancing value over mere comparison matrix attractiveness in sales pitches.

* **Excerpts:** All those new features might look good on a product comparison matrix and give salespeople a new angle when pitching reluctant prospects, but none of it matters if those features arent solving real customer problems. How can product teams focus on value versus To ensure product development resources get expended on actual customer problems, product managers must dig deep into their toolbox. For products to truly address the root cause, product managers must understand the jobs their customers are trying to While its certainly possible that the feature request is spot on, chances are it doesnt fully address the underlying issue or will only address a very narrow set of use cases that dont necessarily fit in with your product vision.

### Mediumroast, Inc.

#### Operating Technology to the Power of Information Technology
**Insight:** The current landscape of compliance in financial processes within industries like financial services and oil and gas necessitates modernization to reduce costs and eliminate misunderstandings between it and compliance teams, as reliance on outdated tools such as microsoft excel for manual review is no longer efficient or scalable, especially considering the complexity introduced by various regulations, litigation risks, and regulatory requirements.

Not so many years ago Nirvana Farhadi related her specialized work to check financial trade compliance was highly dependent upon the usage of Microsoft Excel and an extensive manual review process. Even today, while some modernization has occurred the costs to comply are significant with bespoke teams built for each regulation resulting in misunderstandings between IT and Compliance teams.

**Insight:** The key competitive insight here is that successful businesses are distinguishing themselves by integrating information technology (it) as an integral part of their core operations, unlike industries where it's role is limited to support functions rather than being actively involved in the final production or delivery processes; leveraging this strategic approach through applications of design thinking and customer co-creation with industry expertise can significantly enhance operational efficiency and innovation.

Secondly, careful applications of Design Thinking and customer Co Creation, including industry expertise, is downright mandatory to actually make OT to the power of IT. In truth, the exclusion of IT from directly participating in final production or delivery is an important point because it is now the clear line of demarcation versus those industries that continue to use IT for final production or delivery.

Whereas the people in the meeting said we had little opportunity to help the oil company better manage their data, the individual who worked with the data on a daily basis stated there was plenty of room for better data management tools.

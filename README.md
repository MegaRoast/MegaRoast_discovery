Welcome to your discovery repository meant to help you build products and services via an evidence based approach.  Presently, the repository contains `5` companies and `22` interactions. This repository means to be the warehouse for all evidence needed to generate the why's and what's for your product or service plans.  It is intentionally integrated into GitHub to help you leverage the power of GitHub's ecosystem.
## Companies [ [View Companies](./Companies/README.md) ]
Companies are presently the primary object used and the repository contains `5` of them.  This means you'll be able to find information about these companies in the repository.  Each company has a profile page containing information about the company including its name, description, industry, and location.  Additionally, each company has a list of interactions that are linked to it.
## Interactions
Interaction objects are essentially content related to a company.  They can include meeting notes, emails, product documentation, blog posts, audio transcripts, and more.  While each interaction is linked to a company access to the interaction is presented handled by the company that owns it.
## Studies
Study objects will be a part of a future release of Mediumroast and will be a part of a paid subscription. Stay tuned for more information on this feature and a way to gain access to it.
## Navigation and Modification
Direct navigation and modifcation of repository contents is not recommended. Instead this README file, and accompanying markdown files, will guide you through its contents.  Additionally, the open source node module and CLI `mediumroast_js` [ [GitHub](https://github.com/mediumroast/mediumroast_js) ,  [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mediumroast_js) ] can be used to create, update, and delete content in the repository.
## Notice
**Notice:** This page is automatically generated by the custom GitHub action `basic-reporting`. It is scheduled to run at 12:00 AM everyday and will update `README.md` files in the `/Companies` directory, generate a `<company-name>.md` file for each company in the `/Companies` directory, and update the main `README.md` file in the root of the repository.  Manual updates to these files are not recommended as they will be overwritten the next time the action runs.

## Workflows
The repository contains `2` active workflows. As of `September-2024` `18 minutes` have been consumed. A GitHub free plan has `2000 minutes` available per month meaning there is `1982` remaining minutes for the month. Assuming a repository with 10s of company objects, each workflow runs about a minute at midnight everyday. This means a good hueristic for how many minutes are consumed in a month is 2 workflows/day x 1 min/workflow x 30 days/month or `60 min/month`. To get an accurate view of your consumed minutes for your planning please run `mrcli billing`. The statuses of five most recent workflow runs are provided below, links are included to enable more information on the workflows.
